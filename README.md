| **02. Maze-BFS-Solver** | Breadth-First Search | Shortest path discovery in grid-based mazes with visual tracking. |
| **03. Connectivity-Analysis** | DFS / Tarjan | Finding connected and strongly connected components (SCC). |
| **04. Topological-Sort** | DFS Optimization | Cycle detection and linear-time shortest paths in DAGs. |
| **05. MST-Algorithms** | Prim & Kruskal | Minimum Spanning Tree calculation using Heaps and DSU. |
| **06. Dijkstra-Map** | Dijkstra (XML) | High-performance routing on the real-world Luxembourg road network. |
| **07. Ford-Fulkerson** | Edmonds-Karp | Maximum flow calculation in transport networks (Java). |

## Technical Implementation

* **Data Structures:** Adjacency Lists/Matrices, Priority Queues, Disjoint Set Union (DSU).
* **Performance:** Optimized for large datasets (e.g., Luxembourg map XML) with sub-2s execution times.
* **Non-Recursive:** Implemented using iterative approaches (Stacks/Queues) to handle deep graph traversals without stack overflow.
* **Visualization:** Built with C# GDI+ and JavaFX for dynamic, color-coded algorithmic results.
